            <h5>A. Your Accounts</h5>
            <div class="justify">
                  <p>You may be required to create an account and specify a password in order to use certain services or features on the Sites. To create an account, you must be at least 18 years old and you must provide truthful and accurate information about yourself. Don’t try to impersonate anyone else when you create your account. If your information changes at any time, please update your account to reflect those changes.</p>
                  <p>In some cases, an account may be assigned to you by an administrator, such as your employer. If you are using or logging into an account assigned to you by an administrator, additional terms may apply to your use of the Sites. Moreover, your administrator may be able to access or disable your account without our involvement.</p>
                  <p>You may not share your account with anyone else. Please keep your password confidential, and try not to use it on other websites. If you believe that your account has been compromised at any time, please notify your system administrator.</p>

            <div class="justify">
                  <p>We reserve the right to modify our Sites at any time, with or without notice to you. For example, we may add or remove functionality or features, and we may suspend or stop a particular feature altogether.</p>

                  <p>We may provide opportunities for you to post text, photographs, videos, or other content (collectively, “Content”) on the Sites. You can only post Content if you own all the rights to that Content, or if another rights holder has given you permission.</p>
                  <p>You do not transfer ownership of your Content simply by posting it. However, by posting Content, you grant us, our agents, licensees, and assigns an irrevocable, perpetual (non-exclusive) right and permission to reproduce, encode, store, copy, transmit, publish, post, broadcast, display, publicly perform, adapt, modify, create derivative works of, exhibit, and otherwise use your Content. Without those rights, we couldn’t offer our Services. Please note that this license continues even if you stop using our Sites.</p>
                  <p>You agree to indemnify, release, and hold us harmless from any all liability, claims, actions, loss, harm, damage, injury, cost or expense arising out of any Content you post.</p>
                  <p>Keep in mind that if you send us any information, ideas, suggestions, or other communications to us, those communications will not be confidential. Moreover, unless we tell you otherwise, we reserve the right to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such communications without any obligation to you.</p>

                  <p>Using our Site does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights to the content you access. You may not use content from our Sites unless you obtain permission from us or its owner, or unless you are otherwise permitted by law.</p>
                  <p>When you use a Site or send communications to us through a Site, you are communicating with us electronically. You consent to receive electronically any communications related to your use of a Site. We may communicate with you by email or by posting notices on the Site. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that are provided to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing. All notices from us intended for receipt by you shall be deemed delivered and effective when sent to the email address you provide to us. Please note that by submitting Content, creating a user account or otherwise providing us with your email address, postal address or phone number, you are agreeing that we or our agents may contact you at that address or number in a manner consistent with our Privacy Statement.</p>
